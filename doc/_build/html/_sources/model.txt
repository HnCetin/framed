Loading models
--------------

*framed* supports different kinds of metabolic models. In any case, loading a model is quite simple.

For constraint-based (cobra) models:

::

    from framed import load_cbmodel
    model = load_cbmodel('my_model.xml')

Note that different people have been using different modeling conventions to store constraint-based models in SBML format.
*framed* handles this problem using *flavors*. We currently support two flavors:

- **cobra**: This is the format adopted by the cobra toolbox.
- **fbc2**: This is the new fbc2 extension for SBML.

If can optionally specify the *flavor* of the model you are loading and *framed* will automatically apply a set of rules
to improve compatibility (for example, removing boundary metabolites):

::

    model = load_cbmodel('my_model.xml', flavor='fbc2')


Saving models
-------------

If you apply any kind of changes to a model, you can easily save your model as follows:

::

    from framed import save_sbml_model
    save_sbml_model(model, 'my_output_file.xml')

For constraint-based models you can also specify a specific *flavor* (this is useful for converting between different *flavors*):

::
    save_sbml_model(model, 'my_output_file.xml', flavor='cobra')


Human readable format:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Additionally, *framed* introduces a new shorthand notation for import/export of models in an human-readable format.
(You can see this format by typing ``print model``).

::

    from framed import read_cbmodel_from_file, write_model_to_file
    model = read_cbmodel_from_file('my_file.txt')
    write_model_to_file(model, 'my_new_file.txt')

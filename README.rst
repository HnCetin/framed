FRAMED
======

**framed** is a python package for analysis and simulation of metabolic
models. The main focus is to provide support for different modeling
approaches.

-  Modeling: Constraint-based models, Kinetic models, Bioprocess models

-  I/O: Import/Export from SBML and/or plain text formats

-  Solver support: Gurobi, CPLEX, GLPK

-  COBRA tools:

   -  Simulation: FBA, pFBA, loopless-FBA, MOMA, linearMOMA, ROOM
   -  Analysis: FVA, gene essentiality, PhPP, flux envelope plots
   -  Reconstruction: gapFind, gapFill
   -  Strain design: brute force, hill climbing
   -  Omics integration: GIMME, E-Flux

-  Kinetic tools:

   -  Time-course and steady-state simulation
   -  Parameter and flux sampling
   -  Parameter calibration from data
   -  Plotting utilities

-  Bioprocess modeling: Dynamic FBA (single and multi-species)

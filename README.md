FRAMED
======

FRAMED (**FRA**mework for *M*etabolic *E*ngineering and *D*esign)
is a python package for analysis and simulation of metabolic models.

This package is under development (no stable release yet). Some of the current functionality includes:

* Import/Export of SBML files (constraint-based and kinetic models)
* Import/Export from plain text (constraint-based only)
* Simulation methods: FBA, pFBA, MOMA, linearMOMA, ROOM, loopless-FBA, dynamicFBA
* Analysis tools: FVA, PhPP, production envelope plotting, gene essentiality analysis
* Reconstruction: gapFind, gapFill
* Rational strain design: combinatorial, greedy
* Omics integration: GIMME, E-Flux
* Kinetic models (experimental support): time-course and steady-state simulation, sampling, plotting utils
